# DNA To Protein

Hi everyone, I coded from scratch a way to extract Proteins from SARS-CoV-2 complete Genome (the currently epidemic Coronavirus).
- I start with the DNA of the coronavirus and I transcript nucleotides to an RNA Messenger.
- When I have the RNA Messenger I translate the RNA to a new form for the last part.
- For the last part I have the result of the translation of my RNA and I transfer it to an array of amino acids which are gonna be my final protein.

You could find on the tool the "Program.cs" file which contains all the code.

You will see different methods and these are processes names to transform your DNA to Protein.

The final link is really important because you could see that scientists results are the same than in the console logs code from "Program.cs".
